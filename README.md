# Elementalist-Game (WIP)
My first programming project. A simple 8-bit game using C++/SFML. The purpose of this project is to apply the C++ concepts learned in class and to familiarize myself with git.

TODO List
- Create an Enemy AI class
- Familiarize myself with and implement character and projectile collision.
- Add attack animation
