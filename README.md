# Elementalist-Game (WIP)
My first programming project. A very simple pixel art game using C++/SFML. The purpose of this project is to apply the C++ concepts learned in class and to familiarize myself with git.

**Sample Game play:**

**Intro:**

You are a grim reaper who fears the living. One day, in order to face your fears, you decided to go up to the land of the living and confront the hideous living creatures. You are a master of 4 elements: Fire, Earth, Thunder, and Water. However, you can only attune to 1 element at a time, and for some mysterious reason your elemental affinity randomly changes every 15 seconds. Also, you can summon your trusty ghost pal (by pressing space) to temporarily scare off any Elementalist.

**Rules:**

If you approach the vicinity of an Elementalist weak against your elemental status – you beam with confidence and take their life.

If you approach the vicinity of an Elementalist strong against your elemental status – you experience intense fear and pass out.

If you approach the vicinity of any other Elementalist – you experience a light scare but nothing you can’t handle.

You’re goal is to destroy 10 living beings!
